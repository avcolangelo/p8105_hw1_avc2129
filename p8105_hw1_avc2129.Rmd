## Problem 1

### Creating specified data frame with:
* a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
* a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
* a character vector of length 8
* a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r_library, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r_dataframe}
set.seed(2)

  problem1_df = tibble(
    rand_number = rnorm(8, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    vec_logical = c(rand_number > 0),
    vec_char = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("low", "high", "low", "medium", "high", "medium", "high", "medium"), 
        levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
    )
```
